# Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview
Heart disease is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, imposing significant medical costs and resource burdens on healthcare providers and insurers. Early detection of high-risk individuals can help optimize resource allocation, minimize treatment expenses, and enhance patient care. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict heart disease risk based on various health indicators.

## Dataset Details
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Personal Key Indicators of Heart Disease](https://www.kaggle.com/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease)
- **Format:** CSV
- **Key Features:**
  - Demographic information (age, gender, etc.)
  - Health indicators (BMI, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, etc.)
  - Medical history (diabetes, stroke history, etc.)
  - Lifestyle factors
- **Size:**
  - A version of the file with missing data (NaNs): 445,132 rows. = 139.87MB​
  - A version of the file without missing data (NaNs): 246,022 rows. = 81.98 MB​
- **Features:**
There are 40 features available in the dataset including PhysicalActivities, SleepHours, HadStroke, a summary of your dataset, etc. Update this file as you progress.
