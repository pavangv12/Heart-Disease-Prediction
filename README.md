# Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting heart disease risk based on various health indicators using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle and contains multiple features related to patient health.

## Dataset Details
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Personal Key Indicators of Heart Disease](https://www.kaggle.com/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease)
- **Format:** CSV
- **Key Features:**
  - Demographic information (age, gender, etc.)
  - Health indicators (BMI, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, etc.)
  - Medical history (diabetes, stroke history, etc.)
  - Lifestyle factors

## Technologies & Skills Used
- **Python** for scripting and data processing
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning models
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Kaggle API** for dataset retrieval
- **Machine Learning Techniques** for prediction

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pavangv12/Heart-Disease-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn 
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook heart_disease_prediction.ipynb
   ```

## Usage
- Modify the dataset path in the notebook if needed.
- Experiment with different models to improve performance.
- Use the trained model to make predictions on new patient data.
